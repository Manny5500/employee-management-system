This is the backend for employee management system.

This is my project number 1 in learning Spring Boot.
This explores basic topics such as:
* Entity Relationship
* Entities
* Pagination and Sorting

Features for this app includes:
* CRUD operations
* Searching by name or department
* Pagination and sorting
* Validation

CRUD operations
* I used JpaRepository to perform these.
* I used MsSql for this.

Searching by name or department
* I used HQL for searching by name or department.

Pagination and Sorting
* I used Criteria API for pagination and sorting.
* I created a custom Employee Repository to this and attach to the base repository.
